# Processing-Active-External-USB-CAM
In normally Unlike you active your processing code which open the internal (such as laptop cam)device, you can check your code block with my code.

Note: This process was checked in Processing 1.5.1. Also I 	draw upon GSCapture lib. If you use Capture lib, shuffle that -in prevalent using only Capture-
Note: I will share 3D laserScanner Processing and Arduino codes, as soon as :).
